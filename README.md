# Aseko Local

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

## Summary

Local integration for receiving data directly from **Aseko** pool unit without relying on the **[Aseko Cloud](https://aseko.cloud)**. The imported entities depends on your Aseko device model. Here is an example of ASIN Aqua SALT.

![Home Assistant Sensors](images/sensors-salt.png)

The Aseko unit and your Home Assistant need to run on the same network or traffic needs to be allowed to flow from the unit to the configured port (default is **47524**) as the integration relies on direct data stream from the unit.

**Aseko Local** gives you an option to forward reiceived raw data to Aseko Cloud (or anywhere else).

Sensors that cannot be mapped reliably are **not shown** by default to avoid misleading values.

### Help wanted — expanding device support

If you own an Aseko device that is not listed above as fully supported, you can help by sharing a diagnostics snapshot:

1. In Home Assistant go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Aseko Local**
2. Click on your device, then click **Download Diagnostics** (3-dots menu beside settings symbol)
3. Open a new issue at [github.com/hopkins-tk/home-assistant-aseko-local](https://github.com/hopkins-tk/home-assistant-aseko-local/issues/new) and attach the downloaded JSON file

The diagnostics file contains an annotated table of every byte in the raw data frame sent by your device.

## Installation

### Via HACS - recommended

Use this button to install the integration:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?repository=aseko-local&owner=hopkins-tk)

### Manual installation

There should be no need to use this method, but this is how:

- Download the zip / tar.gz source file from the release page.
- Extract the contents of the zip / tar.gz
- In the folder of the extracted content you will find a directory 'custom_components'.
- Copy this directory into your Home-Assistant '<config>' directory so that you end up with this directory structure: '<config>/custom_components/aseko_local
- Restart Home Assistant Core

## Configure your Aseko unit

You need to re-configure your Aseko unit to send data to your Home Assistant instance.

### Aseko unit configuration

1. Access your Aseko unit IP address

   - default credentials: **admin**/**admin**

2. Go to **Serial Port** configuration

   ![Aseko unit initial configuration](images/aseko-init.png)
   You can see the default **Remote Srver Address** is **pool.aseko.com** (or something similar) and **Local/Remote Port Number** is **47524** or **51050** - make note of that if you would like to keep sending the data there as well - see [Optional: Keep data to Aseko Cloud](#optional-keep-data-to-aseko-cloud)

   The port shown here tells you which firmware version your device is running:
   - **Port 47524** → firmware v7 or older (120-byte binary frame) — fully supported
   - **Port 51050** → firmware v8 (463-byte text frame) — supported
   But you could change it to whatever you want as long as it matches the port you set in the integration settings.

3. Change **Remote Server Addr** to the IP address or DNS record of your **Home Assistant** instance on your local network (or your TCP mirror - see [Optional: Keep data to Aseko Cloud](#optional-keep-data-to-aseko-cloud))

   ![Aseko unit changed configuration](images/aseko-changed.png)

4. Set **Remote Port Number** to the port on which the integration will be listening on your **Home Assistant** instance.

   When adding the **Aseko Local** integration in Home Assistant, set the same port as in your device. The default **47524** works for firmware v7 devices. For firmware v8 devices the default is **51050**.

   > **Mixed setup (two devices, different firmware):** Both devices must send to the **same** port on Home Assistant — the integration uses a single server. Choose one port, set both devices to use it, and set the same port when configuring the integration.

5. Confirm the **Restart** of the module

   ![Aseko unit - modul restart required](images/aseko-restart.png)

### Optional: Send data to Aseko Cloud

If you want to keep sending the data to Aseko Cloud, you had to use a TCP proxy (like [goduplicator](https://github.com/hopkins-tk/home-assistant-aseko-local/issues/14#issuecomment-2897932015)) before release `1.3.0`. The installation and configuration of goduplicator proved trouble some for some of the users and goduplicator has not been updated for over 5 years.

**Aseko Local** has a built in forwarder that can be enabled to forward the raw data received from Aseko Device to Aseko Cloud. To use it, open **Aseko Local** integration, click on settings (see image) and enable the forwarder.

> The forwarder automatically selects the correct destination port based on the frame type received:
> - **Firmware v7 and older** (binary frame) → forwards to `pool.aseko.com` port **47524**
> - **Firmware v8** (text frame) → forwards to `pool.aseko.com` port **51050**
>
> No additional configuration is needed.

## Chemical consumption & canister management

Supported devices report how much chemical each dosing pump has dispensed. The integration exposes two consumption sensors per pump:

- **Since last reset** (`*_since_reset`) — resets to zero when you refill the canister and trigger a reset.
- **Total** (`*_total`) — a running lifetime total that never resets automatically.
- **Reset Button** — a dashboard button to reset the *since last reset* counter after refilling a canister.
- **Pump state** — the integration also decodes pump states (on/off) from the raw data, so you can track when pumps are running in real time and you can analyze the history like how often and how long running.
- **Other information** like canister fill-up volume and remaining volume can be tracked using standard Home Assistant helpers and templates — see below for details.

Here is an example of the consumption sensors and canister settings in Home Assistant:

![Consumption dashboard example](images/aseko_dashboard_example.png)

### Resetting the canister counter

After refilling a chemical canister trigger a reset so the *since last reset* counter starts from zero again.

**Option 1 – Dashboard button**

Add a **button card** or an **entity card** and choose the button entity ***_refill_reset** (see image above).

**Option 2 – Developer Tools**

Go to **Developer Tools → Actions**, search for `aseko_local.reset_consumption` and call it with the pump you refilled (or `all`) and counter `canister`. With this method you can also reset the *total* counter, which is not possible with the dashboard button.

![Reset consumption via Developer Tools](images/aseko_action_reset.png)



### Optional: Track remaining canister volume

Aseko's own app counts down the remaining chemical volume in a canister. You can replicate this in Home Assistant using two standard helpers.

**Step 1 – Number helper for fill-up amount**

Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create helper → Number** and create one helper per chemical, e.g.:

| Field | Example value |
|---|---|
| Name | PH Minus fill-up |
| Minimum | 0 |
| Maximum | 25 |
| Step | 0.1 |
| Unit of measurement | L |

When you refill the canister, update this helper to the volume you actually added before triggering the reset.

![Number helper for canister fill-up](images/aseko_number_canister_fill-up.png)

**Step 2 – Template sensor for remaining volume**

Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create helper → Template → Template sensor** and configure it as follows:

| Field | Example value |
|---|---|
| Name | PH minus remaining fill |
| State template | `{{ states('input_number.ph_minus_fill_up')\|float(0) - states('sensor.ph_minus_since_reset')\|float(0) }}` |
| Unit of measurement | L |
| Device class | Volume |

Adjust the entity IDs to match your own helper and sensor names.

![Template sensor for remaining canister volume](images/aseko_template_sensor_remaining.png)

**Step 3 - Issue utility meter for periodic usage like daily/weekly/monthly consumption**
Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create helper → Utility Meter** and configure it as follows:
- Name: PH minus daily usage
- Meter type: Daily
- Source entity: sensor.ph_minus_total (or sensor.ph_minus_since_reset, depending on your preference)
- reset on: midnight (for daily), or the first day of the month (for monthly), etc.
- Device class: Energy (or None, depending on your preference)
- Unit of measurement: L

**Step 4 – Add everything to a dashboard card**

Combine the fill-up number input, the *since last reset* sensor, the remaining volume template sensor, and a reset button into a single dashboard card for a complete canister management view.
## Water level (ASIN Aqua Home, Salt, Oxy)

Devices with a built-in water-level sensor expose the following entities:

| Entity | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sensor.water_level` | cm | Current water level (real-time) |
| `binary_sensor.water_filling_active` | — | `True` while the auto-fill valve is open |
| `sensor.water_level_low_alarm` | cm | Low-level alarm threshold |
| `sensor.water_level_filling_on` | cm | Threshold that opens the auto-fill valve |
| `sensor.water_level_filling_off` | cm | Threshold that closes the auto-fill valve |
| `sensor.water_level_high_alarm` | cm | High-level alarm threshold |

The raw sensor value reports the **distance from the sensor to the water surface** in centimetres. This matches what the Aseko Live app shows, so no further adjustment is needed for a standard installation.

### Optional: Correct the reading with an offset helper

If your sensor is mounted at a different height than the Aseko factory default (e.g. relocated, installed in a skimmer with an unusual standoff), the displayed centimetres will be off by a constant. You can apply a fixed offset using a Home Assistant template helper.

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create helper → Number** named *Water level offset* with unit `cm`, min `0`, max `+250`, step `1`. Default value `0`.
2. **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create helper → Template sensor**:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Name | Pool water level (corrected) |
   | State template | `{{ states('sensor.aseko_local_water_level')\|float(0) + states('input_number.water_level_offset')\|float(0) }}` |
   | Unit of measurement | cm |
   | Device class | Distance |

This mirrors the same pattern used for canister volume in the previous section and works for any device that exposes `sensor.<device>_water_level` (HOME, SALT, OXY). Devices without a water-level sensor (e.g. NET) will simply not have these entities.

## Backwash (ASIN Aqua Home, Salt, Oxygen, Profi)

The device transmits its backwash **configuration** and the live state of the backwash valve, but never its history — it does not report when the last cycle ran. The integration therefore watches the valve itself and builds the history from what it observes.

Configuration read straight from the frame:

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| `sensor.backwash_every_n_days` | Interval in days (`0` = automatic backwash disabled) |
| `sensor.backwash_time` | Scheduled start time (HH:MM) |
| `sensor.backwash_duration` | Duration in seconds |
| `binary_sensor.backwash_active` | Valve is open right now |

History, recorded live and persisted across restarts. **These are not all equally reliable** — see below:

| Entity | Description | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| `sensor.last_backwash` | Last cycle, whatever started it. **Unknown** until one is seen | **Observed** — it happened |
| `sensor.last_scheduled_backwash` | Last cycle that looked like the unit's own scheduled run | Estimated |
| `sensor.last_manual_backwash` | Last cycle that did not | Estimated |
| `sensor.next_scheduled_backwash` | Projected next automatic cycle. **Unknown** until a scheduled cycle has been observed | Estimated |

### Observed vs. estimated

A cycle is **recorded** when the backwash valve stays open for at least 60 seconds — short activations (menu navigation, output test mode) are ignored. That part is a direct observation: `sensor.last_backwash` means the valve really did run a full cycle.

The device does **not** report *why* the valve opened. So the split into scheduled and manual is a guess based on the only signal available — the time the valve opened:

* within **±15 minutes** of `backwash_time`, on a unit whose schedule is enabled → **scheduled**;
* anything else, including any cycle on a unit with `backwash_every_n_days = 0` → **manual**.

The tolerance absorbs drift between the unit's clock and Home Assistant's, plus up to one transmit interval (~30 s) of lag before the frame reports the valve as open.

`next_scheduled_backwash` is projected from the last **scheduled** cycle: that timestamp plus the configured interval, snapped to `backwash_time`, and stepped forward if cycles were missed while Home Assistant was down. A manual backwash deliberately does not move it — starting one by hand does not tell us (nor, on the unit, change) the schedule phase. Since it builds on the classification, it inherits any error in it.

> **Upgrading:** `sensor.next_backwash` was renamed to `sensor.next_scheduled_backwash`. The integration rewrites the entity registry on startup, so the entity keeps its `entity_id`, its recorded history and any automation or dashboard pointing at it — only the displayed name changes.

### Seeding the schedule by hand

Because the device never transmits its history, `next_scheduled_backwash` stays unknown until the integration has watched a whole scheduled cycle — up to a full interval of waiting. The `aseko_local.set_last_scheduled_backwash` service skips that wait:

```yaml
action: aseko_local.set_last_scheduled_backwash
data:
  timestamp: "2026-08-01 12:30:00"
  # serial_number: 110071590   # optional; omit to set every backwash-capable device
```

The timestamp must be in the past. `sensor.last_scheduled_backwash` then
carries a `source` attribute saying where its value came from:

| `source` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `observed` | The integration watched this cycle run |
| `manual` | You entered it |

`next_scheduled_backwash` has no `source` of its own — it is always projected
from `last_scheduled_backwash`, so that sensor's `source` covers both.

**The last write wins, and the stored timestamps are never compared.**

* Entering a date always applies, whatever it is and whatever was there
  before — if you are typing it in, you have a reason to.
* A scheduled cycle detected *after* that entry replaces it, and the source
  flips back to `observed`. The value you entered stood in for a real cycle
  until one turned up; one has.

So a seed is only ever overtaken by an actual observation, never by an older
record, and you can always take control back by entering a date again.

Seeding deliberately does **not** touch `sensor.last_backwash`: that one means
"the integration watched this happen", and a typed-in date has not been
watched. It also does not touch `last_manual_backwash`, which tracks *observed*
cycles that were started by hand — a different thing from a manually entered
date.

### Known ways the estimate gets it wrong

* A cycle you start **by hand near the scheduled time** is reported as scheduled.
* Only the **time of day** is checked, not the day itself. A manual cycle at exactly `backwash_time` on a day the interval does not fall on still counts as scheduled. (Checking the day would require knowing the schedule phase — which is exactly what this is trying to establish — and would break whenever you change the interval.)
* If the unit's **clock drifts** more than 15 minutes from Home Assistant's, its own scheduled cycles are reported as manual.
* A cycle the unit runs on its own **for some other reason** (e.g. after a fault) is reported as manual.
* Classification uses the schedule **as it was at the time of the cycle** and is never revisited — changing `backwash_time` later does not reclassify history.

If a cycle looks misclassified, the integration's diagnostics download carries `last_backwash_trigger` alongside the raw frame, so you can see what it decided and open an issue.

> **Note:** all four history sensors read "unknown" on a fresh install and stay that way until the integration actually sees a cycle. This is intentional. Earlier versions derived `last_backwash` from the schedule, which showed a confident timestamp for a backwash that may never have happened.
