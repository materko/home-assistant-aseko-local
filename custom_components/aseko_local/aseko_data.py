"""Data model for Aseko pool devices.

This module defines the **protocol-agnostic target schema** (``AsekoDevice``)
that the entity layer (sensors, binary sensors, buttons, …) consumes.  It
also defines the device-type enum, the probe-type enum, the electrolyser
direction enum, and the filtration-mode enum.

Decoder-specific byte-level knowledge (v7 ``byte[29]`` masks, v8 ``fncs:``
capability codes, ``byte[37]`` routing constants, etc.) lives in
``aseko_v7_helpers.py`` and ``aseko_v8_helpers.py`` next to the corresponding
decoder.  The v7 constants ``AsekoActuatorMasks``, ``ACTUATOR_MASKS``, and
``AsekoThirdPumpSlot`` are re-exported at the bottom of this file for
backwards compatibility with existing import sites.
