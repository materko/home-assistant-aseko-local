"""Temporary diagnostic dumper for v8 SALT NET frames (Issue #131 triage).

**Status: TEMPORARY** — this module is a triage aid for the ongoing
mirovra SALT NET investigation. It writes one line per *unique* v8
frame to a Markdown file so the wire-level frame can be compared
against mirovra's "History" screenshot from the Aseko mobile app.

**Activation:** enabled by default while the SALT NET triage is open
(see `DUMP_ENABLED` below). Disable by setting the constant to
`False` once the question list in `docs/temp/issue131_questions_mivovra.md`
is answered. The overhead is negligible — one disk write per
*unique* frame, not per frame — and identical frames are
de-duplicated in-memory (the Aseko app typically sends 0.5–1
frames per second, most of which are identical).

**Dedup: how "only when something changes" works**
The dumper keeps, in memory, the *last seen* raw frame per
device serial. On every `record(raw)` call it:

  1. Renders `raw` to a one-line ASCII string
     (`_frame_to_ascii_line`).
  2. Extracts the serial from the `{v1 <serial> …}` header
     (`_extract_serial`) — frames without a parseable header
     are silently skipped.
  3. Compares the rendered line with the cached one for that
     serial. **If identical → no disk write.** The function
     returns silently.
  4. Otherwise the line is written to the dump file (with a
     timestamp prefix) and the cache is updated.

The on-disk result is therefore a chronological list of *state
changes* — identical frames at 1 Hz for an hour produce zero
writes, while a pump turning on produces exactly one new line
when the corresponding `outs[…]` byte flips. This is what
mirovra's "History" screenshot shows, so the two can be
correlated line-for-line.

**Why raw frames, not decoded fields?** mirovra's screenshot shows
the public Aseko app view (pump running, electrolysis power,
algicide flow rate, …) but not the full configuration. To
correlate the wire-level state with the app view, we need the
*raw* frame on disk so a developer (or mirovra) can decode it
with `scripts/v8_tools.py` and see every section. Crucially,
when mirovra switches the pump from algicide to flocculant (or
toggles a feature), the decoded-field set we are interested in
may *change* — but the raw frame still shows the truth. The
raw-frame approach is forward-compatible: any future field can
be inspected post-hoc without re-running the capture.

**Where the file lives:** `/config/aseko_dump.md` by default. That
is the same directory HA keeps `configuration.yaml` in, so the
file is reachable via VS Code Server (Samba share, File editor
add-on, etc.) without a separate path lookup. On a HA Container
or HA Core install without a `/config` directory, override via
the `ASEKO_DUMP_PATH` environment variable. The file is created
lazily on the first unique frame; it is *not* truncated on each
run, so a long-running HA instance accumulates a chronological
history across restarts.
