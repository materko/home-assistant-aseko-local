"""Persistent tracker for observed filter backwash cycles.

A "successful" backwash is defined as the backwash relay (byte[29] bit 0x01)
remaining continuously active for at least 60 seconds.  Short relay
activations (e.g. menu navigation, output-test mode) are ignored.

That much is observed fact.  Everything else here is derived from it.

Each recorded cycle is *classified* as scheduled or manual by comparing the
moment the relay opened against the unit's configured ``backwash_time``:

    * within ±``SCHEDULED_MATCH_TOLERANCE`` of the configured time, on a unit
      whose schedule is enabled  →  SCHEDULED (the unit ran it itself)
    * anything else                                    →  MANUAL

The device does not transmit *why* the valve opened, nor when it last ran, so
the start time is the only signal available and the classification is a guess
that can be wrong — ``_classify`` lists the specific ways.  Consumers should
treat ``last_backwash`` as reliable and the scheduled/manual split (and the
``next_scheduled_backwash`` projection built on it) as an estimate.

Nothing is guessed before the first observation, though: every value starts out
as ``None``: until a cycle has actually been seen, the honest answer is
"unknown" rather than a timestamp derived from the schedule.

The last scheduled cycle is what drives the "next backwash" projection — a
manual backwash does not reveal (nor, on the unit, reset) the schedule phase.

The recorded timestamps are stored persistently via the Home Assistant
``Store`` API and survive:
    * Home Assistant restarts
    * Integration reloads
    * Integration updates
    * Network interruptions (with a 60s grace period)

Modelled after JS-DE-Tech's hacs-aseko-asin-aqua-home-clf integration:
    * https://github.com/JS-DE-Tech/hacs-aseko-asin-aqua-home-clf

Public API:
    * ``BackwashTracker(hass, serial_number)`` — one instance per device
    * ``await tracker.async_load()`` — call once at startup
    * ``tracker.update(device, now)`` — call after every received frame
    * ``await tracker.async_save()`` — fire-and-forget after a recordable event
    * ``tracker.last_backwash`` / ``last_scheduled_backwash`` /
      ``last_manual_backwash`` / ``last_trigger`` — read-only properties
    * ``tracker.next_scheduled_backwash(device, now)`` — projected next
      automatic cycle
