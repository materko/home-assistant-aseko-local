"""Frame decoding by device profile.

A frame is read in three steps, none of which knows about the others'
internals:

1. ``frames.parse_frame`` turns the raw bytes into a protocol-specific *view*:
   a ``V7Frame`` over the 120-byte binary layout, or a ``V8Frame`` over the
   parsed sections of the text protocol.  This is the only per-protocol
   parsing in the integration.
2. ``profiles.detect_profile`` reads protocol and model off that view and
   looks up one ``Profile``: the ordered list of features the device has,
   which *reading* each of them uses, and a few semantic flags.  Model
   knowledge lives in ``profiles/`` and nowhere else.
3. ``engine.decode`` walks the profile's plan and lets each feature's chosen
   reading read its value.  A feature is one field on ``AsekoDevice`` and
   lives in its own file under ``features/``, holding every known way to read
   that one value for both protocols.  A feature file knows nothing about
   models.

``decode`` below runs the three steps and is the entry point for everything
outside this package.
