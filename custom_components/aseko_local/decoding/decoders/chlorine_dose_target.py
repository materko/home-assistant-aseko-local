"""Timed chlorine dose (ml/m3/h), for units dosing by volume.

byte[53] carries one disinfection setpoint whose meaning depends on the
installed probes, in this order of precedence: a CLF probe makes it the
free-chlorine setpoint, otherwise a REDOX probe makes it the redox setpoint,
otherwise a DOSE probe makes it the timed chlorine dose.  Each of the three
features reads the byte and answers only when it is the one that applies.
