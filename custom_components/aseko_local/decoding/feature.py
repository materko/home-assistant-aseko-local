"""The unit of decoding: one field on ``AsekoDevice``, every way to read it.

A ``Feature`` subclass names exactly one target field and carries the known
readings of that field as methods:

* ``decode_v7`` / ``decode_v8`` are the *default* reading for each protocol.
  A feature that has no reading for a protocol simply does not define the
  method, and no profile of that protocol may list it.
* Any further ``decode_<protocol>_<name>`` method is a named *reading* a
  profile can select instead of the default, for the models whose frame is
  encoded differently.  The feature file does not know which models those
  are; the profile does.
* ``decode_<protocol>_not_located`` exists on every feature: the model has
  the value (its menu or manual shows it) but nobody has found where the
  frame carries it yet.  It always reads None, so the entity exists and shows
  "unknown", and the support matrix lists it as a place to look.

Every reading receives the frame view and the partially decoded device, so
a feature may read fields decoded before it.  Which fields those are is
declared in ``depends_on`` and honoured by the profile's ordering, never
checked at run time: a wrong order fails loudly at import, not quietly in
the field.
