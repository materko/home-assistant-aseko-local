"""Measured air (ambient) temperature (degrees C).

16-bit big-endian two's complement at bytes 23-24, / 10 -- the same encoding
as water_temperature, which sits directly after it.  Confirmed on an ASIN
AQUA Salt against two diagnostics dumps, both matching the unit
display:

    2026-08-11 10:33 -> 0x0168 = 36.0 C air | 0x0128 = 29.6 C water
    2026-08-17 18:50 -> 0x0134 = 30.8 C air | 0x0122 = 29.0 C water

Signedness: read unsigned, units without an air probe decode to 6513.6 C
(0xFE70) and 6502.8 C (0xFDC4); as two's complement the same bytes read
-40.0 C and -57.2 C, i.e. an open-circuit input.  A genuine sub-zero reading
has not been captured yet, so the plausibility window below keeps both
sentinels out either way.  0xFFFF is rejected before the window because as a
signed value it would read a plausible -0.1 C.
