"""Period 1 stop of the filtration timer.  v7: bytes 58-59 (hour, minute).

Filtration periods share bytes 56-63 on every model with a filtration output.
The unit keeps sending the last configured period-2 times even after period
2 is disabled at the controller (Issue #133, verified on serial 110169464),
so the bytes are read as-is; whether period 2 is active is what
filtration_schedule says.
