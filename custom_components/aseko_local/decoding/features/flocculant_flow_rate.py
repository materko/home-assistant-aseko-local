"""Configured flocculant pump flow rate (ml/min).

Two layouts exist for the algicide / flocculant pair, and which one a model
uses is a property of the model -- so this feature offers both readings and
the profile picks:

Independent ports (OXY, HOME): flocculant at byte[101], algicide at
    byte[103] -- confirmed on OXY (2026-04-11, algicide = 60 ml/min).  HOME
    reads flocculant at byte[101] (Issues #110, #115); its algicide rate is
    not located, because byte[103] is the refill start level there (see the
    HOME profile evidence).

Shared port (SALT; PROFI assumed): one physical pump at byte[101], configured
    for either chemical.  NET has neither pump.  byte[37] bit 0x80 set = algicide, clear =
    flocculant (confirmed by @hopkins-tk on SALT v7.x and consistent with
    @jmnemonicj, SALT v5.0, Issue #84).  byte[37] = 0xFF = configuration
    unknown, both stay None.
