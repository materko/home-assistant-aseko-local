"""Safety function: the maximum number of pH doses.

After this many doses without the pH moving, the unit stops dosing and
raises "Too many doses of pH".

v7: byte[115].  Confirmed on the maintainer's ASIN AQUA Salt on 2026-09-12:
the setting was changed from 20 to 17 on the unit's Safety Functions screen
and byte[115] followed (0x14 -> 0x11) while every other unmapped byte stayed
put.  Reads 40 on the maintainer's other SALT, 20 on the HOME frame in
home_device_analysis.md, 30 on the OXY frames and 0xFF on every NET frame
captured so far.
