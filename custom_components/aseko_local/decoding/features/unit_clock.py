"""The unit's own clock as it sent it, with nothing filled in from Home Assistant.

``timestamp`` falls back to Home Assistant's clock when the unit sends none,
which is right for a "when" but useless for asking how far the unit's clock
is off.  This field keeps only what the unit sent, for ``trackers.clock``:

* v7: bytes 6-11 as a ``datetime`` (year offset 2000) in Home Assistant's
  time zone -- the unit sends wall-clock time with no zone of its own;
* v8: ``ins[16]`` / ``ins[17]`` as a ``time`` -- hour and minute, no date.

None when the bytes are unset or not a valid date.  A model that never
sends its clock (v7 NET: 0xFF on every frame) does not list the feature.
Both readings share their byte rules with ``timestamp`` (``frames.values``).
