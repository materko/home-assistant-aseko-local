"""Current water level (cm).  v7: byte[27].

Water level, on models with a level probe and a filling valve.  Confirmed
byte positions (domin211, DomSchCoding #100, Issue #110):

    byte[27]  = current level (cm)
    byte[29] bit 0x02 = filling valve open
    byte[102] = low alarm threshold (cm)
    byte[103] = filling ON threshold (cm)
    byte[104] = filling OFF threshold (cm)
    byte[105] = high alarm threshold (cm)

NET carries unrelated non-0xFF data in bytes 102-104, so no NET profile
lists these.  OXY has no level probe and sends its algicide flow rate in
byte[103] instead.  HOME uses bytes 102-105 for the level thresholds like
SALT (confirmed there against the unit, 2026-09-11); where HOME sends its
algicide flow rate is not known.
