"""v8 profile: ASIN AQUA Salt NET.

Takes over the NET layout minus the chlorine pump -- a SALT makes its
chlorine by electrolysis -- and adds what only a salt unit sends: salinity,
the electrolyser, and the third pump port, whose chemical ``fncs[6]`` names.

The salt readings come from Issue #131, where an owner labelled captures
with what the app showed at that moment, and from a second unit (Issue #131,
firmware 106) whose display was compared with one frame.  That unit's owner
ran it for days on the v1.9.x decoder patched for header 106 (Issue #169) and
timed a real algicide dose against ``outs[11]``.
