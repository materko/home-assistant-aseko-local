"""v8 profile for a header type that names no known model.

Reads the layout every v8 unit seen so far shares, so the diagnostics of
such a unit show as much as the frame can say.  Nothing here is verified for
the unit at hand: the coordinator keeps it out of the entity platforms and
reports it in diagnostics as unrecognised, like the v7 unknown unit type.
