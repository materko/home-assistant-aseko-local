"""Render the profiles as a human-readable support matrix (Markdown).

The matrix is generated, never edited by hand: ``scripts/generate_support_matrix.py``
writes it to ``docs/support_matrix.md`` and a test fails when the committed
file is out of date.  Everything in it comes from the profiles' feature
lists, overrides and ``evidence`` entries, so keeping those honest keeps the
document honest.
