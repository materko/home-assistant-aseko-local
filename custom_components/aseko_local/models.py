"""Data model for Aseko pool devices.

This module defines the **protocol-agnostic target schema** (``AsekoDevice``)
that the entity layer (sensors, binary sensors, buttons, ...) consumes.  It
also defines the device-type enum, the probe-type enum, the electrolyser
polarity enum, the filtration-schedule enum, and the two enums that describe
*how* a device was decoded: the fields its profile reads and the semantic flags its
profile carries.

Byte-level knowledge lives in ``decoding/``: one feature file per field in
``decoding/features/``, and one profile per (protocol, model) in
``decoding/profiles/``.  Nothing in this module knows a byte offset, and
nothing outside ``decoding/`` should either: the entity layer asks
``AsekoDevice.features`` and ``AsekoDevice.flags`` instead.
