"""A ring buffer of raw frames and user markers, capped in compressed bytes.

While recording is on (the test cases card turns it on), every frame the
server receives (v7 binary, v8 text, partial, rejected) is appended as one
JSON line with the Home Assistant receive time.  A marker from ``mark_dump``
or the card goes into the same stream once the next decoded frame arrives,
so a change on the unit and the frames that carry it line up by position,
without anyone comparing clocks.  A display photo is kept by ``photos`` and
named in its marker; the zip export packs both.

The ceiling is hard: the sealed compressed chunks, plus the compressed bytes
of the chunk being written, plus the records not yet handed to its
compressor (counted uncompressed) never exceed ``max_bytes``, whatever the
units send.  When the next record would pass it, whole chunks are dropped
from the old end.

Consecutive frames of a unit differ in a few digits, so they compress well
once the receive time stops being the noisiest field: the first record of
each chunk carries the absolute time (``t``) and every later one only the
seconds since the previous record (``dt``).  With that, 256 kB holds about
five days of one v8 unit sending every ten seconds.

The buffer is kept in a Home Assistant ``Store`` so it survives a restart,
and the diagnostics download carries it as one base64 zlib blob -- decode it
with ``scripts/frame_log_tool.py`` -- plus the markers and the latest records
in plain text.
