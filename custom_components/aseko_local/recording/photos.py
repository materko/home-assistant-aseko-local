"""Photos of the unit's display that go with frame-log markers, and the zip export.

The Aseko test cases card uploads a photo straight from the phone's camera.  The
upload writes a marker into the frame log at the moment it arrives and keeps
the photo here, named after that moment, so photo and frames line up without
EXIF data, file names or anyone comparing clocks.  Messengers strip all of
those; this path never leaves Home Assistant.

Photos are downscaled (longest side ``MAX_SIDE`` px, JPEG) when Pillow can
read them, and the folder is capped in bytes and count: the oldest photos go
first.  ``build_export_zip`` packs frames, markers, diagnostics and photos
into one file to attach to a GitHub issue.

Everything here is blocking file and image work: call it from an executor.
