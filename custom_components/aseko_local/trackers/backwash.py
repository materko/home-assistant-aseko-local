"""Persistent tracker for observed filter backwash cycles.

A "successful" backwash is defined as the backwash relay (byte[29] bit 0x01)
remaining continuously active for at least 60 seconds.  Short relay
activations (e.g. menu navigation, output-test mode) are ignored.

That much is observed fact.  Everything else here is derived from it.

Each recorded cycle is *classified* as scheduled or manual by comparing the
moment the relay opened against the unit's configured ``backwash_start_time``:

    * within ±``SCHEDULED_MATCH_TOLERANCE`` of the configured time, on a unit
      whose schedule is enabled  →  SCHEDULED (the unit ran it itself)
    * anything else                                    →  MANUAL

— except on units that report their settings menu (below), where MANUAL
needs the menu to have been open outside the window, and a cycle that neither
the schedule nor the menu explains is UNKNOWN.

The device does not transmit *why* the valve opened, nor when it last ran, so
on most units the start time is the only signal available and the
classification is a guess that can be wrong — ``_classify`` lists the specific
ways.  Consumers should treat ``last_backwash`` as reliable and the
scheduled/manual split (and the ``next_scheduled_backwash`` projection built
on it) as an estimate.

Units whose profile carries ``AsekoProfileFlag.MENU_BIT_IS_PRESENCE_ONLY``
(SALT today) are the exception: byte[37] bit 0x04 marks their settings menu
being open, and that is the menu a backwash is started by hand from — so a
cycle that runs while the bit is set is manual as a matter of observation
rather than inference — outside the schedule window.  In the window a cycle
is always SCHEDULED; outside it with the menu closed it is UNKNOWN: nobody was
at the menu and the schedule does not explain it.  See ``_service_menu_open``.

Nothing is guessed before the first observation, though: every recorded value
starts out as ``None``: until a cycle has actually been seen, the honest answer
is "unknown" rather than a timestamp derived from the schedule.  The one
projection made without an observed cycle is the day after a schedule change
(below), because the unit itself fixes that day.

The last scheduled cycle is what drives the "next backwash" projection — a
manual backwash does not reveal (nor, on the unit, reset) the schedule phase.
A change of the schedule does reset it: once the unit shows a new backwash
time or interval, or the schedule switched back on, its next cycle runs the
day after the change at the new time and the interval counts from there
(confirmed on an ASIN Aqua Salt).  The tracker keeps that day as an anchor
until a scheduled cycle on it, or later, has been seen.

The schedule is set on the unit's own clock, which runs apart from Home
Assistant's (``trackers.clock``).  Once the offset is measured, classification
compares the cycle's start with the schedule on the unit's clock, within the
tighter ``OFFSET_MATCH_TOLERANCE``.  The offset is the whole difference, drift
and a change of time (summer / winter) the unit did not follow alike.  The
projection is not moved by it: it shows the backwash time exactly as it is
set on the unit, and ``clock_offset`` tells how far that is from Home
Assistant's clock.

The recorded timestamps are stored persistently via the Home Assistant
``Store`` API and survive:
    * Home Assistant restarts
    * Integration reloads
    * Integration updates
    * Network interruptions (a gap of up to ``MAX_FRAME_GAP`` keeps a cycle open)

Modelled after JS-DE-Tech's hacs-aseko-asin-aqua-home-clf integration:
    * https://github.com/JS-DE-Tech/hacs-aseko-asin-aqua-home-clf

Public API:
    * ``BackwashTracker(hass, serial_number)`` — one instance per device
    * ``await tracker.async_load()`` — call once at startup
    * ``tracker.update(device, now)`` — call after every received frame
    * ``await tracker.async_save()`` — fire-and-forget after a recordable event
    * ``tracker.last_backwash`` / ``last_scheduled_backwash`` /
      ``last_manual_backwash`` / ``last_trigger`` — read-only properties
    * ``tracker.next_scheduled_backwash(device, now)`` — projected next
      automatic cycle

    anything is touched, so on its own it says only that a person is at the
    unit.  Paired with a running backwash it says more: a capture of a
    by-hand cycle has the bit set on every frame from ~30 s before the valve

    manual override that forces the pump off and can stay set indefinitely;

        within ``SCHEDULED_MATCH_TOLERANCE`` of the configured time of day —
        whatever the menu did.  Outside that window ``service_menu_observed``
        decides: on SALT the unit reports somebody at its menu while the valve
        was open (see ``_service_menu_open``), so the cycle is manual; with
        the menu closed it is UNKNOWN on SALT and, by elimination, manual on
        units that do not report the menu.

        That part is a guess, not a fact.  The device reports that the valve
        opened, never why, so the start time is all there is to go on.  Known

        * A cycle started by hand within the tolerance window of the scheduled

          at exactly ``backwash_start_time`` on a day the interval does not fall on
          still counts as scheduled.  Checking the day would need the schedule
          phase, which is precisely what we are trying to establish, and would
          break whenever the user changes the interval.
        * Before the unit's clock offset is known (``clock_offset``), a unit
          whose clock is more than the tolerance off Home Assistant's has its
          own scheduled cycles reported as manual.  With it known, the start
          is compared on the unit's clock within ``OFFSET_MATCH_TOLERANCE``.
        * A cycle the unit runs on its own for some other reason (e.g. after a
          fault) is reported as manual.

        Classification uses the schedule as it was in the frame at the time of
        the cycle, and is never revisited: changing ``backwash_start_time`` later
        does not reclassify history.
