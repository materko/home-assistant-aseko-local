## Raw Frame (120 bytes)

The Aseko protocol sends 3×40-byte segments in a single TCP payload.
Each segment header: `[0-3]` serial (big-endian), `[4]` device type, `[5]` segment marker (`0x01 / 0x03 / 0x02`), `[6-11]` timestamp.

† pH 6.29 vs 6.56 and water temp 37.9 vs 38.2 are explained by different timestamps (frame: 08:27:07, screenshot: later that day). Not a decoding bug.

§ **byte[37] = `0x43`**: This is the **HOME filtration mode flag** (see Issue 4). The value `0x43` here means *FILTRATION NONSTOP 24H* (also reported as such in the Aseko Live app on this device). HOME devices have **independent pump ports** for flocculant and algicide (same layout as OXY Pure), so the SALT-style "shared third-pump port" routing rule (bit 7 = algicide) does **not** apply. The HOME-specific flowrate branch (analogous to OXY) was added in commit 0e78e4d and now reads `byte[101] → flowrate_floc` and `byte[103] → flowrate_algicide` independently — see Bug 3 below.

#### Actuator byte[29] — HOME masks (uncertain)

| Bit   | Mask   | Field                  | Value (0x00) |
|-------|--------|------------------------|-------------|
| bit 3 | `0x08` | filtration_pump_running | False ✓     |
| bit 6 | `0x40` | cl_pump_running        | False ✓     |
| bit 7 | `0x80` | ph_minus_pump_running  | False ✓     |
| bit 5 | `0x20` | algicide / floc running | False ✓    |

All masks marked **uncertain** — confirmed only from their absence (byte[29]=0x00 when nothing is running). Need frames captured while individual pumps are active to confirm per-pump bits.

### ✅ Resolved: `max_filling_time` is **not** in bytes 94–95

Earlier revisions of this document placed `max_filling_time` at bytes[94:96] and noted
that it overlapped `flowrate_ph_minus` at byte[95], with both reading `0x003c` = 60. The
note said only a frame with a non-zero byte[94] could prove or disprove the assumption.

**That assumption was wrong.** The field lives in **bytes 76–77** as big-endian *seconds*,
matching the encoding of its neighbours `delay_after_startup` (74–75) and
`delay_after_dose` (106–107). Bytes 94–95 were never the filling time — byte 95 is
`flowrate_ph_minus` and byte 94 is still unidentified.

The old offset looked correct only because this unit runs a **60 ml/min pH− pump** and had
a **60 min filling limit** at the same time, so `0x003c` satisfied both readings. The same
coincidence appears in every OXY frame in the repo (`byte[95]` = 60 ml/min, byte[94] = 0),
which is why it survived review for so long.

**Evidence, this frame:**

| Bytes | Hex | Value | Field |
|---|---|---|---|
| 74–75 | `01e0` | 480 s = **8 min** | `delay_after_startup` — ✓ app shows 8 min |
| 76–77 | `2a30` | 10800 s = **180 min** | `max_filling_time` — whole minutes, 3 h |
| 106–107 | `00f0` | 240 s = **4 min** | `delay_after_dose` — ✓ app shows 4 min |

All three are big-endian seconds that divide evenly into whole minutes. Bytes 74–75 and
106–107 are independently confirmed against the Aseko Live app on this device, which fixes
the encoding; 76–77 sits between them and follows the same pattern.

**Direct proof** came from an ASIN AQUA Salt unit (firmware v7): changing the setting in
the Aseko Live app from 30 to 47 min left bytes 94–95 pinned at `0x003c` while bytes 76–77
tracked the change exactly (`0x0708` = 1800 s → `0x0B04` = 2820 s).

⚠️ The **180 min** value for this HOME unit is *not* confirmed against an app screenshot —
the original capture did not include the filling-time page. What is confirmed is the
offset and the encoding; the value follows from them.

## Bugs Found

### Bug 1 (Fixed) — `required_floc` not decoded for HOME devices

**Root cause**: `_fill_required_data` decodes byte[54] as either `required_floc` or `required_algicide` only when `masks.byte37_routes_pump_type is True`. For HOME devices `byte37_routes_pump_type = False` (correct — HOME has independent pump ports), so the entire byte[54] block was silently skipped.

**Evidence**: byte[54] = `0x0a` = 10 → required_floc = 10 ml/h. Aseko Live Config confirms **Flocc: 10 ml/hour**.

**Fix applied** (`aseko_decoder.py`): Added a HOME-specific branch (parallel to OXY) that unconditionally decodes byte[54] as `required_floc`. Test: `test_decode_home_clf_real_frame`.

---

### Bug 2 (Fixed) — `required_algicide` not decoded for HOME devices

**Root cause**: Same as Bug 1 — the byte[54]/byte[72] routing block was skipped for HOME. HOME uses the same byte positions as OXY Pure.

**Evidence**: Aseko Live Config shows **Algicide: 0 ml/m³/day**. Frame byte[72] = `0x00` = 0.

**Fix applied** (`aseko_decoder.py`): The same HOME branch also decodes byte[72] as `required_algicide` (identical to OXY layout). Test: `test_decode_home_clf_real_frame`.

---

### Bug 3 (Fixed) — HOME `flowrate_algicide` and `algicide_pump_running` missing

**Root cause**: `_fill_flowrate_data` only had an OXY early-return and a SALT/NET/PROFI fallthrough. For HOME, the SALT fallthrough was used: it routed `byte[101]` exclusively to either `flowrate_algicide` (when `byte[37] & 0x80`) or `flowrate_floc` (otherwise). HOME devices have **independent** pump ports (same as OXY), so this routing is wrong on two counts:
1. `byte[103]` (the HOME algicide flowrate) was never read.
2. The `byte[37]` bit 7 has no meaning on HOME (no shared pump port).

As a downstream effect, `_fill_consumable_data` short-circuited `algicide_pump_running` because `flowrate_algicide is None`, so the `algicide_pump_running` binary sensor was never registered. This is the root cause of the [Issue #115](https://github.com/hopkins-tk/home-assistant-aseko-local/issues/115) report: *"no entity for Algacide pump running"*.

**Evidence**:
- This frame (serial 110128063): `byte[101] = 0x0a = 10 ml/min` matches Aseko Live "Floc+c 10 ml/min". `byte[103] = 0x21 = 33` is the algicide pump capacity.
- [Issue #110 frame](https://github.com/hopkins-tk/home-assistant-aseko-local/issues/110) (serial 110071590): `byte[103] = 0x0b = 11 ml/min` → Aseko Live "Algicide listed" (dose is 0, but the installed pump capacity is reported).

**Fix applied** (`aseko_decoder.py`): Added a HOME-specific early-return branch in `_fill_flowrate_data` (parallel to OXY), reading `byte[101] → flowrate_floc` and `byte[103] → flowrate_algicide` independently. The `byte[37]` value is ignored on HOME.

**Tests added** (in `tests/test_aseko_decoder.py`):
- `test_decode_home_independent_flowrates` — verifies HOME reads byte[101]/byte[103] independently of byte[37] (tested with both `0x53` and `0xB3` to prove byte[37] is irrelevant on HOME).
- `test_decode_home_flowrates_unspecified` — 0xFF on flowrate bytes → `None` (e.g. pump not installed).
- `test_decode_home_algicide_pump_running` — covers Issue #115: `algicide_pump_running` binary sensor is now correctly registered.
- `test_decode_home_floc_pump_running_independent` — verifies HOME reports `floc_pump_running` correctly when only floc pump is installed (byte[103] = 0xFF).

### Issue 3 (Pending — low-water condition at capture time)

**Observation**: byte[55] = `0x19` = 25 → decoded as 25°C. Aseko Live shows "---" for Water temp (disabled/not configured).

**Context**: The frame was captured while Aseko Live was showing an error, most likely caused by insufficient water in the pool (evidenced by cl_free = 0 and filtration pump stopped). The device may report a placeholder/default value in certain fields during an error or standby state, which would explain the "---" in the app despite byte[55] being non-zero.

**Action needed**: Request a new frame when the pool is running normally and compare byte[55] — if the water temperature control feature is enabled and active, the decoded value should match the app. Until then this issue remains unresolved.

---

### Issue 4 ✅ Resolved — Filtration nonstop mode flag is byte[37]

**Observation**: Aseko Live Config shows **FILTRATION NONSTOP 24H**. The decoder produces start1=08:00, stop1=16:00, start2=18:00, stop2=22:00 (12 h total — inconsistent with nonstop mode).

**Context**: The frame was captured while the pool had an error (likely too little water). The filtration pump was stopped and byte[29] = 0x00, consistent with an active alarm suppressing normal operation.

**Resolution (Issue #110)**: `byte[37]` encodes the filtration mode flag.

**Superseded**: the original resolution compared `byte[37]` against `0x43` / `0x53`
exactly. That works on HOME and nowhere else — see the updated rule below.

**Current rule**: `byte[37]` is a **bitfield**, and bit `0x10` is the *timer active* flag:

- bit `0x10` clear → NONSTOP 24H
- bit `0x10` set → timer mode

| byte[37] | bit `0x10` | Mode | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x43` | clear | NONSTOP 24H | HOME, this frame |
| `0x53` | set | Timer | HOME, issue #110 |
| `0xC3` | clear | NONSTOP 24H | SALT fw v7, captured live |
| `0xD3` | set | Timer | SALT fw v7, same unit, toggled in the app |
| `0xb7` `0xb3` `0x37` `0x13` | set | Timer | reported by other SALT users |
| `0x47` / `0x57` | clear / set | NONSTOP 24H / Timer | see note below |

The upper nibble carries unrelated flags that differ per device type and per pump routing,
which is why exact-value comparison missed every SALT unit. Bit `0x20` in the same byte is
already used elsewhere as the period-2 enable mask, so treating this byte as a bitfield is
consistent with existing decoding.

`0x00`, `0x03` (OXY) and `0xFF` (NET) are **excluded sentinels** and decode to `None`. An
all-zero byte has bit `0x10` clear and would otherwise be reported as NONSTOP 24H, but a
byte that was never populated carries no mode at all.

**Change of behaviour for `0x47` / `0x57`**: this table previously listed them as a
transitional/edit state to be left as `None`. They differ from `0x43` / `0x53` only in bit
`0x04`, so under the bitfield reading the mode is still recoverable and they now decode.
No captured frame contains either value — the entry was a hypothesis, and it is covered by
a regression test rather than by field evidence.

**⚠️ Note on the issue #110 evidence**: The diagnostics frame is from **2026-05-23 17:09** (after mannekung changed the filtration schedule to NONSTOP 24H on **2026-05-09**), but `byte[37]` still reads `0x53` (timer). The screenshot from the same user shows the "Suche" indicator (search mode) in the bottom-right corner, which may explain the mismatch — the device might be reporting a transient or special mode rather than the user-configured setting. **Until a frame is captured with a known NONSTOP 24H state and no special UI mode, treat `0x43` as "consistent with NONSTOP 24H" rather than "confirmed NONSTOP 24H active".**

`filtration_nonstop24` is decoded for **all device types**. This paragraph previously
claimed that non-HOME units never produce a value, because their `byte[37]` is never
exactly `0x43`/`0x53`. That was a consequence of the exact-comparison bug, not of the
hardware: under the bit `0x10` rule **SALT units now decode**, and the values other SALT
users reported (`0xb7` `0xb3` `0x37` `0x13`) all turn out to mean *timer*. OXY (`0x03`) and
NET (`0xFF`) remain `None`, now by explicit sentinel rather than by accident.

### Issue 5 ✅ Resolved — HOME `flowrate_algicide` is byte[103] (independent port)

**Observation**: Aseko Live Consumption page shows **Algicide** as a tracked chemical. `flowrate_algicide` was `None` in the decoded output before the fix.

**Resolution**: HOME devices use the same independent-pump-port layout as OXY Pure. The HOME-specific flowrate branch was added in `_fill_flowrate_data` (parallel to OXY), reading:
- `byte[101] → flowrate_floc` (always)
- `byte[103] → flowrate_algicide` (always)

No `byte[37]` routing is involved on HOME.

**Evidence**:
- This frame (serial 110128063): `byte[101] = 0x0a = 10 ml/min` → matches Aseko Live "Floc+c 10 ml/min".
- `byte[103] = 0x21 = 33` — confirmed in the [Issue #110 frame](https://github.com/hopkins-tk/home-assistant-aseko-local/issues/110) (serial 110071590, `byte[103] = 0x0b = 11`) that algicide uses byte[103] with the same ml/min unit. The non-zero value when `required_algicide = 0` suggests the controller still reports the *installed pump capacity* even when the dose is set to zero — similar to how the flocculant pump continues to report 10 ml/min when no flocculant is being dosed.

**Side effect**: The `algicide_pump_running` binary sensor (which was always missing before the fix because `flowrate_algicide is None` short-circuited the assignment in `_fill_consumable_data`) is now correctly registered and reflects `byte[29] & 0x20`. This addresses the [Issue #115](https://github.com/hopkins-tk/home-assistant-aseko-local/issues/115) report "no entity for Algacide pump running".

## Applied Fixes

1. **`aseko_decoder.py` → `_fill_required_data`** — added HOME device branch (parallel to OXY, no early return so `required_cl_free` / `required_redox` are still decoded via the CLF branch):
   - byte[54] → `required_floc` (ml/h)
   - byte[72] → `required_algicide` (ml/m³/day)

```python
# HOME: has both CLF/REDOX setpoint at byte[53] AND independent floc/algicide setpoints.
# Same byte layout as OXY Pure for these two fields (confirmed 2026-04-28, frame analysis).
if unit.device_type == AsekoDeviceType.HOME:
    unit.required_floc = AsekoDecoder._normalize_value(data[54], int)
    unit.required_algicide = AsekoDecoder._normalize_value(data[72], int)
    # Fall through to decode required_cl_free (byte[53]) via the CLF branch below.
```

2. **`aseko_decoder.py` → `_fill_flowrate_data`** — added HOME-specific branch (parallel to OXY, with early return so SALT routing logic is skipped). Reads `byte[101] → flowrate_floc` and `byte[103] → flowrate_algicide` independently. No `byte[37]` routing applies on HOME.

```python
if unit.device_type == AsekoDeviceType.HOME:
    # HOME has independent pump ports for flocculant and algicide.
    # Same layout as OXY Pure for these two flowrates.
    unit.flowrate_chlor = AsekoDecoder._normalize_value(data[99], int)
    unit.flowrate_floc = AsekoDecoder._normalize_value(data[101], int)
    unit.flowrate_algicide = AsekoDecoder._normalize_value(data[103], int)
    return
```

**Tests added** (in `tests/test_aseko_decoder.py`):
- `test_decode_home_independent_flowrates` — verifies HOME reads byte[101]/byte[103] independently of byte[37].
- `test_decode_home_flowrates_unspecified` — 0xFF on flowrate bytes → `None`.
- `test_decode_home_algicide_pump_running` — covers [Issue #115](https://github.com/hopkins-tk/home-assistant-aseko-local/issues/115): the `algicide_pump_running` binary sensor is now correctly registered.

## Open Items

| # | Status | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 3 | Pending | `required_water_temperature` vs app "---" — need normal-operation frame (heating is disabled on this device; only a frame from a pool with heating enabled can confirm byte[55]) |
| 4 | ✅ Resolved | Filtration NONSTOP 24H flag byte — `byte[37]` bit `0x10` is the timer flag (clear = nonstop). Supersedes the earlier exact match on `byte[37] == 0x43`, which missed every SALT unit. |
| 5 | ✅ Resolved | `flowrate_algicide` byte position — confirmed as `byte[103]` on HOME (Issue #115) |
| 6 | New | `byte[29]` bit masks for HOME pumps remain **unconfirmed** — see §"Actuator byte[29] — HOME masks (uncertain)" above. The masks in `ACTUATOR_MASKS[HOME]` are placeholders matching OXY/NET. Capturing frames with a single HOME pump running (e.g. algicide only) would pin down the per-pump bit. Until then, both `algicide_pump_running` and `floc_pump_running` may report incorrectly on HOME when the corresponding pump is active. |
| 7 | ✅ Resolved | `max_filling_time` was never in bytes 94–95. It is **bytes 76–77**, big-endian seconds; byte[95] is `flowrate_ph_minus` and byte[94] is unidentified. The old offset matched only because this unit had a 60 ml/min pH− pump and a 60 min filling limit simultaneously. Proven by toggling the setting in the Aseko Live app on a SALT unit (fw v7) and re-reading the frame. See §"Resolved: `max_filling_time` is not in bytes 94–95". |
| 8 | New | `heating_active` binary sensor (byte[29] bit 0x04) — added for [Issue #115](https://github.com/hopkins-tk/home-assistant-aseko-local/issues/115) "Entities for heating are not there" request. Mapping is the same as JS-DE-Tech's `relay_byte` bit 2. **Live confirmation pending** — needs a frame captured while the heat pump / electric heater is actually running. Currently it cannot be distinguished from the unconfirmed HOME pump-bit masks. |
