# ASIN AQUA Salt – Reverse Engineering & Implementation Notes

## Device

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | ASIN AQUA Salt |
| Firmware | 5.x – 7.x |
| Source | PR #87 live captures 2026-04-04; earlier frames 2026-04-02, 2026-04-03; Issue #84 |
| byte[4] | `0x0E` (Redox) or `0x0D` (CLF) or `0x0f` (DOSE) → `(data[4] & 0x0C) == 0x0C` → **SALT** |

---

## Frame Structure

All SALT frames are 120 bytes, split into three 40-byte sub-frames. The sub-frame type is
encoded at byte offset 5 (first sub-frame), 45, and 85:

| Sub-frame | Type byte | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 0–39 | `0x01` | Live sensor data |
| 40–79 | `0x03` | Configuration / setpoints |
| 80–119 | `0x02` | Flow rates / dosing |

---

## byte[4] – Unit Type Detection

`UNIT_TYPE_SALT = 0x0C`. Detection: `(data[4] & 0x0C) == 0x0C`.

Known values observed: `0x0D`, `0x0E`. Both match the SALT mask.

**Convention**: **Bit SET (`1`) = probe ABSENT; bit CLEAR (`0`) = probe PRESENT** (negative/inverted
convention, named `PROBE_X_MISSING` in the code).

| Bit | Mask | Constant | Bit SET (1) means | Bit CLEAR (0) means |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0x01` | `PROBE_REDOX_MISSING` | REDOX probe **absent** | REDOX probe **present** |
| 1 | `0x02` | `PROBE_CLF_MISSING` | CLF probe **absent** | CLF probe **present** |
| 2–3 | `0x0C` | `UNIT_TYPE_SALT` | **SALT type identifier** (both bits must be set) | — |

## Air temperature — byte `[23:25]`

Bytes 23-24 hold the air (ambient) temperature as a 16-bit big-endian two's
complement value, `value / 10` = °C — the same encoding as the water
temperature that follows it in bytes 25-26. The field was previously listed as
"unknown".

**Evidence** — two diagnostics dumps from serial 110194590 (ASIN AQUA Salt,
type byte `0x0d`), both matching the readings shown on the unit:

| Captured | Bytes 23-24 | Air | Bytes 25-26 | Water |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-11 10:33 | `0x0168` = 360 | 36.0 °C | `0x0128` = 296 | 29.6 °C |
| 2026-08-17 18:50 | `0x0134` = 308 | 30.8 °C | `0x0122` = 290 | 29.0 °C |

Both fields move independently, and each raw air value occurs exactly once in
its 120-byte frame, so the offset is unambiguous. Byte 22 stayed `0x18` in both
samples, so this is a plain 16-bit field and not the low half of a 24-bit one.

**Signedness.** Read unsigned, frames from units without an air probe decode to
6513.6 °C (`0xFE70`) and 6502.8 °C (`0xFDC4`); as two's complement the same
bytes read -40.0 °C and -57.2 °C, i.e. an open-circuit temperature input. The
decoder therefore reads the field signed and discards anything outside
-30.0 … 60.0 °C, which filters both sentinels. A genuine sub-zero reading has
not been captured yet, so the cold-weather encoding remains unverified.

`0xFFFF` is rejected up front as the protocol-wide "unspecified" marker — read
signed it would otherwise pass the window as -0.1 °C.

**Scope.** Only SALT is enabled (`AIR_TEMPERATURE_TYPES`). Frames from other
types carry values in these bytes that do not read as an ambient temperature
(e.g. `0x0C3C` = 313.2 °C on a NET unit), so they stay excluded until a dump
from that type is checked against its display.

## byte[29] – Actuator Bitmask

### Confirmed masks

**Source: PR #87 captures 2026-04-04 (55 type-01 frames, two distinct phases)**

| Bit | Mask | Phase | Observed byte[29] | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | `0x08` | Filtration | baseline `0x08` | Set in all active phases (04-04) ✅ |
| 4 | `0x10` | Electrolyzer RIGHT | `0x18 = 0x08\|0x10` | 25 frames (04-04 Phase 4) ✅ |
| 5 | `0x20` | Algicide / Flocculant pump | `0x28 = 0x08\|0x20` | 27 frames (04-04 Phase 2) ✅ |
| 6 | `0x40` | Electrolyzer LEFT (tentative) | `0x58 = 0x08\|0x10\|0x40` | 1 frame (04-02) ⚠️ tentative |

**Key insight**: Algicide and Flocculant both use **the same bit `0x20`**. The third pump
port is a single physical output. The chemical type is determined by `byte[37]`, not by
a separate bit in byte[29].

### Unconfirmed masks

| Bit candidate | Mask | Hypothesis | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | `0x80` | pH− pump | ⏳ No frame captured with pH− pump running |

### Pump states are exclusive (not parallel)

The SALT unit has only **one third-pump port**. Algicide and flocculant are mutually
exclusive configurations — the pump cannot run as both simultaneously. The electrolyzer
and algicide/flocculant CAN be active at the same time (each has a separate pump/output).

---

## byte[37] – Third-Pump Routing (Algicide vs. Flocculant)

The SALT unit has one physical pump port that can be configured as either algicide or
flocculant. `byte[37]` encodes which chemical is active:

| byte[37] value | bit 7 | Chemical configured |
|---|---|---|
| `0xb7`, `0xb3` | `1` | **Algicide** (ml/m³/day) |
| `0x37` | `0` | **Flocculant** (ml/h) |
| `0xFF` | N/A | Not configured / NET device |

**Routing rule (Hopkins firmware v7.x)**: `byte[37] & 0x80 == 0x80` → algicide; else → flocculant.

### Firmware variant caution

Issue #84 SALT shows `byte[37] = 0x13` for algicide. Here bit 7 (`0x80`) is **not** set —
the routing bit differs from the v7.x firmware. The two SALT variants encode the chemical
type differently in byte[37].

**Implication**: the `0x80` routing rule is not universally reliable across all SALT
firmware versions. See [byte37_algicide_floc_analysis.md](../temp/byte37_algicide_floc_analysis.md) for
full XOR analysis.

**Note on Period 2 schedule bytes (Issue #133)**: On SALT, the controller keeps
sending the last-configured `start2`/`stop2` times in bytes 60-63 even after
the user disables Period 2 in the controller UI.  Pre-fix, the decoder
gated these fields on `byte[37] & 0x80` and returned `None` for any frame
where the algicide-routing bit was clear — which caused already-registered
entities to flip to "unknown" when the user toggled Period 2 on/off
(Home Assistant protects the entity registry, so the entity stays but
the value is read as `None`).  Post-fix, bytes 60-63 are read
unconditionally for any device in `FILTRATION_TYPES` (SALT included) and
`filtration_mode` is decoded directly from the `byte[37]` filtration-mode
flag (see §byte[37] below).  Behaviour was originally verified on SALT by
diffing two frames
captured in PR #122 (algicide mode toggle, `0xb3` ↔ `0x33`); the
corresponding behaviour for HOME was confirmed in Issue #133 with
@dtpugh's four diagnostic files (see
[`home_device_analysis.md`](home_device_analysis.md) §"Note on Period 2
schedule bytes (Issue #133)").  NET is excluded because it has no
filtration output.

### byte[37] also contains other fields

`byte[37]` is a packed multi-field byte — it is **not** a pure single-bit flag:

| Comparison | XOR | Bit(s) changed |
|---|---|---|
| Algicide 10 → Algicide 11 (dosage +1) | `0x04` | bit 2 only |
| Algicide 11 → Flocculant 11 (type change) | `0x84` | bit 7 + bit 2 |
| Algicide 10 → Flocculant 11 (both change) | `0x80` | bit 7 only |

Bit 2 (`0x04`) appears related to dosage encoding. The full semantics of all bits are not
confirmed.

### byte[37] also carries the filtration-mode flag

Since Issue #133 the decoder reads the 4-state filtration mode directly from
`byte[37]` for every `FILTRATION_TYPES` device (SALT included), using the same
two firmware encodings as HOME — see
[`home_device_analysis.md`](home_device_analysis.md) §"byte[37] – Filtration
mode flag" for the full table.  In brief:

| `byte[37]` high nibble | Encoding | Filtration mode |
|---|---|---|
| `0x4` / `0x5` (firmware A) | exact values | `0x43` → `NONSTOP_24H`, `0x53` → `TIMER_PERIOD_1_AND_2` |
| `0x0` / `0x1` / `0x3` (firmware B) | bit flags | `0x04` → `MANUAL`; `(b & 0x30)` → `0x00`=`NONSTOP_24H`, `0x10`=`TIMER_PERIOD_1`, `0x30`=`TIMER_PERIOD_1_AND_2` |

Note the overlap with the third-pump routing / dosage encoding above: bit 2
(`0x04`) is interpreted as the manual-override flag by the filtration-mode
decode on SALT as well.

## Byte Map – Sub-frame 2 (config / setpoints)

| Byte(s) | Decoded | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[52]` | Required pH = value / 10 | |
| `[53]` | Required CLF (mg/L ÷10) or REDOX (×10 mV) | Depends on active probe |
| `[54]` | Required algicide (ml/m³/day) or Required floc (ml/h) | Routed by `byte[37]` |
| `[55]` | Required water temperature (°C) | |
| `[56:58]` | Filtration start1 | HH:MM |
| `[58:60]` | Filtration stop1 | HH:MM |
| `[60:62]` | Filtration start2 | HH:MM | Always populated — see Issue #133 |
| `[62:64]` | Filtration stop2 | HH:MM | Always populated — see Issue #133 |
| `[68]` | Backwash every N days | `0` = disabled |
| `[69:71]` | Backwash time | HH:MM |
| `[71]` | Backwash duration | ×10 seconds |

## Byte Map – Sub-frame 3 (flow rates)

| Byte(s) | Decoded | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[92:94]` | Pool volume (m³) | |
| `[95]` | Flowrate pH− (ml/min) | Confirmed |
| `[99]` | Flowrate chlorine pump (ml/min) | Not applicable on SALT (no CL pump) |
| `[101]` | Flowrate third-pump slot (ml/min) | 60 ml/min in all captured frames |
| `[103]` | Flowrate third-pump slot (duplicate?) | Also 60 ml/min; does not flip with algicide/floc switch |

**Note on byte[101] vs byte[103]**: Both bytes carry the same flowrate (60 ml/min)
regardless of whether algicide or flocculant is configured. The third pump slot does NOT
split its flowrate across different bytes when switching chemicals — see
[byte37_algicide_floc_analysis.md](../temp/byte37_algicide_floc_analysis.md).

## Electrolyzer

The SALT unit has an integrated salt-water electrolysis cell for chlorine production.

| Field | byte | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `electrolyzer_active` | `[29] & 0x10` | `True` when RIGHT cycle running |
| `electrolyzer_power` | `[21]` | Raw value; `0` when not running |
| `electrolyzer_direction` | `[29]` bits | `0x10` = RIGHT; `0x50 = 0x10|0x40` = LEFT (tentative) |
| `salinity` | `[20]` | g/L, value / 10 |

**Electrolyzer direction**: RIGHT direction is confirmed (`0x10`, 25 frames, Phase 4).
LEFT direction (`0x40`) is tentative — based on a single April 2 frame (`0x58 = 0x08|0x10|0x40`)
where the interpretation of bit `0x40` is uncertain.

## Open Questions

| Question | Status |
|---|---|
| pH− pump mask in byte[29]? | ⏳ Candidate `0x80` — consistent with HOME/OXY; awaiting frame |
| Electrolyzer LEFT mask? | ⚠️ Tentative `0x40` — single frame, April 2, 2026 |
| byte[37] full field layout? | ⏳ Bits 0–6 partially known; full semantics not confirmed |
| byte[37] routing for Issue #84 firmware? | ⚠️ `0x13` = algicide but bit 7 NOT set — different firmware variant |
| byte[103] semantics? | ⏳ Always mirrors byte[101] on SALT — may be a duplicate or separate pump |
