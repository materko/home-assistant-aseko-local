# Support matrix

What each decoding profile reads, and how sure we are.  Generated from `custom_components/aseko_local/decoding/profiles/` by `scripts/generate_support_matrix.py`; do not edit by hand.

A **profile** is one (protocol, model) combination.  A **feature** is one field on `AsekoDevice`, i.e. one value the integration can read.

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | read on this model, checked against the unit display or the Aseko Live app on **this** model — or *derived*: it follows from the protocol or from confirmed values (the evidence text says which) |
| 👁 | seen repeatedly in captures from a real unit with consistent, plausible values, but not compared with the unit display or the app — **a glance at the unit would settle it** |
| ❓ | read on this model, but not checked on it: assumed, or confirmed only on another model — **a diagnostics dump would settle it** |
| — | the profile does not read it: the model does not have the value, or the integration does not decode it (yet); no entity is created |
| 🔍 | this model has the value (its menu or manual shows it), but where the frame carries it is not known yet: the entity exists and reads unknown — **a diagnostics dump before and after changing it on the unit would settle it** |
| `decode_…` | the profile uses this reading instead of the protocol default |

Further profiles exist that no unit is meant to decode with and that the tables leave out: **v7 unknown unit type** and **v8 unknown header type**.  They read an unmapped unit (v7 unit type, v8 header type) with the generic readings so it shows as much as possible in diagnostics, where it is reported as unrecognised; it gets no entities.

## Help wanted

Every entry below is read today without a confirming capture.  If you own one of these units, a diagnostics download taken while the value is visible on the unit or in the Aseko Live app is exactly what is needed.

### v7 HOME

- `air_temperature` — assumed: bytes 23-24 = 0xFE70 (no air probe, the SALT marker) in every captured HOME frame, so its entity has stayed disabled; the Aseko Live app shows air temperature on HOME units
- `alarm_no_flow_to_probes` — confirmed on NET: byte[13] 0x04 (DomSchCoding, NET frame)
- `alarm_rapid_ph_change` — assumed: byte[13] 0x08 was set on serial 110128063 with no matching alarm known in the app
- `algaecide_pump_running` — assumed: byte[29] 0x10 as on OXY, which has the same four independent pump ports (0x20 is the flocculant); read only once the algicide flow rate is located, so no state yet
- `backwash_running` — assumed: byte[29] 0x01, confirmed on SALT
- `chlorine_dose_target` — assumed: byte[53] with a DOSE unit type, as on NET; no DOSE HOME frame captured
- `chlorine_pump_running` — assumed: byte[29] 0x40, port may be chlorine or OXY Pure
- `flocculant_pump_running` — assumed: byte[29] 0x20 as on OXY (confirmed there)
- `flow_detection_enabled` — confirmed on SALT: byte[37] 0x02 (2026-09-13); on HOME 0x43 / 0x53 have it set and Issue #135's 0x41 / 0x45 / 0x49 clear
- `heating_linked_to_filtration` — assumed: byte[38] 0x10 as on SALT (confirmed there, 2026-09-14); no HOME frame compared
- `heating_running` — assumed: byte[29] 0x04 per JS-DE-Tech relay_byte bit 2; no HOME frame with the heater running (open item 9)
- `max_refill_time` — assumed: bytes 76-77 = 10800 s on serial 110128063, plausible (180 min); verified on SALT only
- `ph_minus_pump_running` — assumed: byte[29] 0x80
- `redox` — assumed: bytes 16-19 as on SALT (bytes 18-19 when not 0xFFFF); no REDOX HOME frame with the app's value
- `redox_target` — assumed: byte[53] x 10 mV as on SALT; no REDOX HOME frame compared
- `water_level_refill_start` — confirmed on SALT: byte[103], bytes 102-105 are the level thresholds (SALT 2026-09-11 against the unit); 33 cm on serial 110128063 sits between the low alarm 13 and the refill stop 55
- `water_level_sensor_enabled` — confirmed on SALT: byte[37] 0x40 (2026-09-13); set in every frame of the level-meter HOME units (once 'firmware A'), clear on serial 110169464 (once 'firmware B')

### v8 NET

- `chlorine_flow_rate` — assumed: not transmitted, 60 ml/min taken for consumption
- `chlorine_pump_running` — assumed: outs[9] per the current decoder; net_v8_device_analysis.md lists outs[0] / outs[1] as candidates and no frame shows a pump running
- `ph_minus_flow_rate` — assumed: not transmitted, 60 ml/min taken for consumption
- `ph_minus_pump_running` — assumed: outs[8] per the current decoder; net_v8_device_analysis.md lists outs[0] / outs[1] as candidates and no frame shows a pump running

### v8 SALT

- `filtration_running` — assumed: only the header type (1xx) says SALT; the NET layout is taken over unverified
- `ph_minus_flow_rate` — assumed: only the header type (1xx) says SALT; the NET layout is taken over unverified
- `ph_minus_pump_running` — assumed: only the header type (1xx) says SALT; the NET layout is taken over unverified
- `water_flow_to_probes` — assumed: only the header type (1xx) says SALT; the NET layout is taken over unverified

## Not located yet

Values these models have but nobody has found in the frame.  If you own one of these units, download diagnostics, change the setting on the unit, wait a minute and download again: the two frames show where it is.

### v7 HOME

- `algaecide_flow_rate` — not located: byte[103] was read as the algicide flow rate (Issues #110, #115), but bytes 102-105 are the water level thresholds -- confirmed on SALT against the unit (2026-09-11) and 13 / 33 / 55 / 100 cm in order on serial 110128063; the captured OXY sends its algicide flow rate there, and has no level sensor connected

### v7 OXY

- `freeze_protection_enabled` — not located: the ASIN AQUA Oxygen manual describes freeze protection; no OXY frame has been compared with it
- `heating_control_enabled` — not located: the ASIN AQUA Oxygen manual describes heating control; no OXY frame has been compared with it
- `water_level_refill_start` — not located: byte[103] carries the algicide flow rate on OXY (confirmed, 60 ml/min), so the refill start threshold is elsewhere on an OXY with a level sensor; the captured OXY has none

## Seen, not compared

Values captured from real units that nobody has yet checked against the unit display or the app.  If you own one of these units, comparing the entity with what the unit shows is all it takes.

### v7 HOME

- `backwash_schedule_enabled` — observed: byte[22] 0x10 set on serial 110128063 with backwash every 3 days (0x90); confirmed on an ASIN AQUA Salt (2026-09-13)

### v8 SALT

- `alarm_max_disinfection_dose` — observed: ins[12] bit 0x80 flipped 0 -> 128 while the unit showed 'Maximum disinfection dose exceeded' (Issue #151)
- `algaecide_dose_target` — observed: areqs[4] = 5 with the port set to algicide 5 ml/m3/day, 0 after it was switched to flocculant (Issue #131)
- `algaecide_pump_running` — observed: outs[11] with the chemical from fncs[6] (10 algicide, 18 flocculant): the same unit read 10 with algicide configured and 18 after its owner switched the port on 2026-07-19 (Issue #131)
- `dosing_delay` — observed: areqs[18] = 5, the 5 min the unit is set to (Issue #131); the NET v8 sends 2 for its 2 min
- `filtration_period_1_end` — observed: reqs[7] = 20 on a unit its owner set to a timer until 20:00, 24 on one running nonstop (Issue #131)
- `filtration_period_1_start` — observed: reqs[5] = 8 on a unit its owner set to a timer from 08:00, 0 on one running nonstop (Issue #131)
- `flocculant_dose_target` — observed: areqs[3] = 10 with the port set to flocculant 10 ml/h, 0 while it was algicide (Issue #131)
- `flocculant_pump_running` — observed: outs[11] with the chemical from fncs[6] (10 algicide, 18 flocculant): the same unit read 10 with algicide configured and 18 after its owner switched the port on 2026-07-19 (Issue #131)
- `startup_delay` — observed: areqs[17] = 5, the 5 min the unit is set to (Issue #131); the NET v8 sends 2 for its 2 min
